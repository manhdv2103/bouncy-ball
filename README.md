# bouncy-ball
bouncy-ball is a simple 2d bouncy ball physics simulation I wrote for fun when learning about the [Web Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), inspired by this [chapter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Advanced_animations).

## How to play
1. Go to [https://manhdv2103.github.io/bouncy-ball](https://manhdv2103.github.io/bouncy-ball).
2. Use your mouse to drag and drop the ball.
3. Have fun!!!
